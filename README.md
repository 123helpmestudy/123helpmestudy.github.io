## Running the application locally

Development / testing can be done locally by invoking a small server, the command `python3 -m http.server 5500` in the root directory could be used to run a leightweight Python server.

## Testing

Testing is done manually by following all the steps in [this google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1seaOJnTFmAHrJk27ERoy5l5hOMvmXhIqR5GWXXJZZHo).

## Deployment
